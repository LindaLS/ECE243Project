baa baa black sheep
have you any wool
yes sir yes sir
three bags full
one for the master
one for the dame
one for the little boy
who lives down the lane


alligator pie alligator pie
if i dont get some i think im gonna die
give away the green grass give away the sky 
but dont give away my alligator pie
